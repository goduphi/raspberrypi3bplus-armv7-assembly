All of the programs in this repository were homework problems from class.

### Resource used:
Dr. Jason Losh's notes and programs  
The University of Texas at Arlington
  
### File descriptions
- hw2_prob5.c - C program that calls the assembly functions in hw2_prob.c
- hw2_prob5.s - Basic programs in assembly
- hw3.c - C program that calls the assembly functions in hw3.s
- hw3.s - Intermediate to advanced level programs in assembly (includes a sorting algorithm)
- hw4.s - Includes programs that make use of the vector processor in the Raspberry Pi
- hw4.c - C program that calls the assembly functions in hw4.s

### Compilation instructions:
- `gcc filename.c filename.s -o filename -g`

Note: The -g flag is optional. I only used it for debugging purposes.  

### Usage
- `./filename`
